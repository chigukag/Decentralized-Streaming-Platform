# ðŸŽ¥ Decentralized Streaming Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary decentralized streaming platform built on the Stacks blockchain! This project eliminates high platform fees (often 30-50% on traditional platforms) by enabling direct creator-to-consumer content distribution. Creators retain more revenue, and users gain access to content with transparent pricing and ownership.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ“¹ **Direct Content Upload**: Creators upload content metadata and access keys to the blockchain.
- ðŸ’¸ **Fair Revenue Sharing**: Automated royalty distribution via smart contracts, bypassing middlemen.
- ðŸ”’ **Access Control**: Users purchase access to content with STX, unlocking streaming rights.
- ðŸ—³ **Community Governance**: Token-based voting for platform upgrades and dispute resolution.
- ðŸ“Š **Transparent Analytics**: Immutable records of views, purchases, and payouts.
- ðŸ”„ **Subscription Model**: Flexible subscriptions for recurring access to creator content.
- ðŸš« **Censorship Resistance**: Decentralized storage ensures content availability.

## ðŸ›  How It Works

### For Creators
1. **Register Content**: Upload content metadata (title, description, IPFS hash) and set pricing.
2. **Set Royalties**: Define revenue splits for collaborators (e.g., co-producers, artists).
3. **Manage Subscriptions**: Offer tiered access (e.g., premium content, early releases).
4. **Track Earnings**: View real-time analytics on views and revenue.

### For Consumers
1. **Browse Content**: Explore a decentralized catalog of media.
2. **Purchase Access**: Pay with STX to unlock content via smart contract.
3. **Stream Content**: Access content via IPFS or other decentralized storage.
4. **Vote on Governance**: Use platform tokens to influence platform policies.

### For Verifiers
- **Check Ownership**: Verify content ownership and authenticity via blockchain records.
- **Audit Royalties**: Confirm fair distribution of revenue to creators and collaborators.
